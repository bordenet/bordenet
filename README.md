# 👋 Hi, I’m Matt Bordenet

Seattle-based software engineering leader with a passion for building high-performing teams, shaping engineering culture, and embracing modern toolchains that elevate how we build. I’m especially energized by the LLM wave—it’s the first time in years I’ve felt a platform shift truly reshaping how we think, design, and deliver. (I never felt this way about blockchain or VR.)

### Projects & Repositories I’m Proud Of

#### 📌 Thought Leadership
- **[Engineering_Culture](https://github.com/bordenet/Engineering_Culture/blob/main/README.md)** – Short-form essays on engineering practice, leadership, and how AI-first workflows are changing the game.
- **[Transformation_Case_Studies](https://github.com/bordenet/Transformation_Case_Studies)** – Real-world stories of engineering and organizational change, drawn from hard-earned lessons in the field.
- **[ai-fundamentals-simple](https://github.com/bordenet/ai-fundamentals-simple)** - Instructional guide for engineering leaders. I have a private version with Jupyter notebooks and coding problems.

#### 🛠 Tooling & Implementation Work
- **[product-requirements-assistant](https://github.com/bordenet/product-requirements-assistant)** – AI-powered CLI that reviews PR-FAQs and spec docs.
- **[pr-faq-validator](https://github.com/bordenet/pr-faq-validator)** – A Go-based LLM tool that parses PR-FAQs and gives feedback straight from the terminal.
- **[secrets-in-source](https://github.com/bordenet/secrets-in-source)** – Tooling to detect secrets committed to source control.
- **[apple-quartile-solver](https://github.com/bordenet/apple-quartile-solver)** – A Go app for solving Apple News “Quartile” puzzles.

### Why This Work Matters

I focus on building tools and practices that **make engineers more effective**, not replace them. LLM agents are already reshaping our SDLC—from ideation and requirements to reviews and validation. I’m deeply interested in the next wave of AI-native tooling and the cultures that will enable it.

If you're building teams, practices, or systems with similar goals, I’d love to trade notes.
