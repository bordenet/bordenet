# 👋 Hi, I’m Matt Bordenet

Seattle-based **engineering leader and builder** with a passion for scaling high-performing teams, shaping engineering culture, and modernizing platforms. I stay deeply technical—hands-on in cloud-native systems and operational excellence—and I love the craft of simplifying complexity.

The current LLM wave is the most profound platform shift I’ve seen in decades. It’s not hype; it’s a redefinition of how we ideate, design, and deliver software. I never felt that way about blockchain or VR.

## 🧭 What I Build

### Vibe Coding
- **[RecipeArchive](https://github.com/bordenet/RecipeArchive/blob/main/README.md)** – A clean, practical recipe manager built for speed and simplicity—no long stories, just great food. My main sandbox lately for testing AI-assisted development and identifying where current tools still fall short. Support for web, iOS, Android.
- **[identity-deep-dive](https://github.com/bordenet/identity-deep-dive)** - OAuth2/OIDC authorization server, security scanners, and multi-tenant session management - learning identity protocols and patterns through implementation.
- **[codebase-reviewer](https://github.com/bordenet/codebase-reviewer)** – AI-powered codebase analysis and onboarding tool that generates structured prompts for systematic code review. Exploring documentation-first analysis patterns and automated tech debt detection.
- **[apple-quartile-solver](https://github.com/bordenet/apple-quartile-solver)** – Go-based solver for Apple News "Quartile" puzzles, because sometimes problem solving _can_ be literal.

### Thought Leadership
- **[Engineering_Culture](https://github.com/bordenet/Engineering_Culture/blob/main/README.md)** – Essays on engineering leadership, velocity, and the evolving craft of software in the AI era. I lead with context—not control—and these essays are just a small sample of how I help organizations scale clarity, alignment, and execution.
- **[Transformation_Case_Studies](https://github.com/bordenet/Transformation_Case_Studies)** – Real-world stories of engineering and organizational transformation: what worked, what didn’t, and what the data revealed. I share these to provide **hard evidence** of outcomes—not just opinions—about scaling teams and culture change.
- **[ai-fundamentals-simple](https://github.com/bordenet/ai-fundamentals-simple)** - A practical, approachable guide to AI fundamentals for engineering leaders. The private edition includes Jupyter notebooks and exercises used to **level up teams**—bridging the gap between theory and applied AI practice.

### 🛠 Tooling & Implementation Work
- **[product-requirements-assistant](https://github.com/bordenet/product-requirements-assistant)** – AI-powered app that helps build, review, and improve Product Design Specs (PRDs) for clarity, consistency, and completeness. I built this for a time when I wore a Product Manager hat.
- **[pr-faq-validator](https://github.com/bordenet/pr-faq-validator)** – Go-based LLM-assisted terminal tool that parses [PR-FAQs](https://github.com/bordenet/Engineering_Culture/blob/main/SDLC/The_PR-FAQ.md) and provides rigorous feedback and scoring.
- **[secrets-in-source](https://github.com/bordenet/secrets-in-source)** – Lightweight (and FAST!) scanner to detect secrets accidentally committed to source control. Requires custom regex investment.
- **[scripts](https://github.com/bordenet/scripts/blob/main/README.md)** – Simple, purpose-built tools and utilities. These are practical scripts I've written to solve specific problems—feel free to adopt, adapt, or build on them for your own use.

## Why This Work Matters

My focus is on **amplifying engineers**, not automating them away.

LLMs are already reshaping the software lifecycle—from ideation and design to reviews and delivery. I’m exploring how AI-native workflows will evolve engineering culture, velocity, and quality in the decade ahead.

If you’re building **tools, systems, or teams** to make engineers more effective, I’d love to compare notes.

_Clarity isn’t a luxury—it’s a performance multiplier. Teams that understand what great looks like consistently outperform those that don’t._
