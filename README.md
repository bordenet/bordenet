- **Amazon (Software Development Manager):** Led video playback API teams for Amazon Instant Video during a time of rapid expansion

## Current Focus

Building tools and writing about engineering leadership, operational excellence, and AI-assisted development. All repos are working code or real-world case studies.

## Projects

### DocForge AI

**[docforge-ai](https://github.com/bordenet/docforge-ai)** generates business documents using adversarial AI review. Claude drafts, Gemini critiques, Claude synthesizes. Supports 9 document types: one-pagers, PRDs, ADRs, PR-FAQs, job descriptions, and more.
