# Matt Bordenet

Engineering leader with 26+ years building platforms and leading teams at Amazon, Warner Bros. Discovery (iStreamPlanet), Stash Financial, and Telepathy.AI. Based in Seattle.

## What I Do

I rebuild fragile systems into reliable platforms and transform engineering cultures from reactive to proactive. Recent work includes:

- **Telepathy.AI (VP Engineering):** Scaled conversational AI infrastructure from prototype to production, supporting 50M+ monthly conversations across global operations
- **Stash Financial (VP Engineering):** Reduced platform downtime 60% while maintaining SOC-2/FINRA/FDIC compliance for 2M+ users
- **iStreamPlanet (Director):** Rebuilt streaming platform to 99.99% uptime, scaled to 180+ live channels, selected as Warner Bros. Discovery's go-forward technology post-acquisition
- **Amazon (Software Development Manager):** Built video streaming infrastructure for Amazon Instant Video

## Current Focus

Building tools and writing about engineering leadership, operational excellence, and AI-assisted development. All repos are working code or real-world case studies.
